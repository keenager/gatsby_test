### Gatsby's File System Route API [link](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-6/#render-post-contents-in-the-blog-post-page-template)

#### Key GraphQL Concept: Query Variables
To use the query variable inside your query, do the following:

1. **Define your query variable.** It should include the variable name (with a $ in front of it) and its GraphQL data type.
1. **Use the query variable in your query.** (You’ll need to add a $ before the variable name.)


When you use Gatsby’s File System Route API, it automatically adds some props into the page template component for each page:

- The id for the data layer node used to create the page.
- The field you used to create the dynamic part of the route. (In this case, the slug field.)

Under the hood, Gatsby makes both of these values available to use as query variables in your page queries.

```js
query MyQuery($id: String) {
  mdx(id: {eq: $id}) {
    frontmatter {
      title
      date(formatString: "MMMM D, YYYY")
    }
    body
  }
}
```
